<p>Reflection #0: The slide deck at <a href="http://j.mp/1000kg">http://j.mp/1000kg</a> represents a compendium of all the tactics  that have worked for Ashok Bakthavathsalam in his mentoring work with some students at KITE from 2012-2017.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection #1 - the primary purpose of the PPT deck to develop the same “language” of communicating the importance of goal setting, some specific tactics for setting goals and how to go about taking specific action in alignment with the goals (the 4Ps). Goal setting (i.e. to become a genius) is equally important for faculties as well as students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection #2 - Reinforce the thought that you as faculty are the source of creating self-confidence for the student. Whatever you do or do not do, make them “believe” in themselves. #4P - Proactive conviction must be created in the minds of the students. Easier said than done. But then who said being a faculty is an easy job?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection #3 - The slide deck is also to make each faculty gain conviction in that the KGISL campus is the best place for students to build their personal branding. Example: Slide #12 - the slide can convey a 1000 words; how Dinesh Babu is building skills, one month at a time, 100 hours every month, and that skill building is also being accompanied by a <strong>paid stipend</strong>, which builds self-esteem in himself, that he <strong>“earning while learning”.</strong> Use the deck to <strong>“trigger”</strong> other students by asking “If Dinesh Babu can do it, why aren’t you doing it?” Create and Collect your own stories as to how students are benefiting by pursuing their academics in the campus, i.e. starting their career long before they graduate. Insert a couple of slides in the appropriate place in my original PPT deck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action Item #1 - Add slides to the PPT deck as to how you can be a “Promise Extractor”. Junior faculty might find it difficult, but everyone can become a promise extractor, big or small, it doesn’t small. It is important to be specific and communicate that to students. I have added 3 slides (after the word “remix”) as a set of sample slides.</p>
