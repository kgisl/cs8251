## Array and Pointers

- http://j.mp/pointerWalkVideo will demonstrate the pointer and how it is used to operate on an array. 
- Try out the problem on CC at http://j.mp/pointerWalk to practice this yourself.
- Write your own `strlen` function using pointers at http://j.mp/strlenCC 

The *essential* difference between a **pointer** and **array** is 
 
  - the array variable is constant; its address value cannot be changed whereas a pointer's value can be changed. However, they both can be used in pointer arithmetic
