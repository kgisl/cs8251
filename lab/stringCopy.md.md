## stringCopy

Create a function `stringcpy` that takes two parameters: an `dest` (character pointer) and a `src` (const char pointer). 

Copy the contents from `src` to the `dest`ination. Return the pointer `dest` as the return value of the function.

### Required definitions
- Define three versions of `stringcpy` function as 
	- `stringcpy1()` (using array subscripting), 
	- `stringcpy2()` (using pointers) ,  
	- `stringcpy3` - the most professional version and 
	- `stringcpy4` as a single and simple one line function.  
- Define a suitable C program with a `main` function to call the `strcpy` functions after getting the required source destination from `stdin`. 
- The given `main` function must not be edited. Use it as it has been provided, otherwise the test cases may not pass. 

### Example

input: `abc` `de `  
output:  `abcde`  

input: `copy this`   
output: `copy this`
