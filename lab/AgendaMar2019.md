KITE - **CSE** department 

## Pre-requisites
  - Basic C programming (loops, conditionals, variables-arithmetic-operators, functions, sequences) - the 5 constructs
  - Who can demonstrate http://j.mp/rntCKITE or http://j.mp/diagonalKG or http://j.mp/diamondKG 
	  - Video keys 
  - Have an understanding of all the functions in the [standard C string](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/string_h.htm) library  

# Agenda

High level  
	 - **6th construct** -  Indirection (using pointers in C - 'special' variables  
	  - **7th construct** Recursion (functions calling functions)  

Features of the workshop 
  - specific construct orientation - pointers in the language 
  - sub-skills are provided with sub-problem sets 
  - immediate feedback on progress through CloudCoder 
  - Walk in the path of the "master" - using videos as keys for specific exercises 

## Non-coding 

1. Join http://j.mp/room8251  
	- Github profile building as a preferred social coding resume   
	- "_Begin with the end in mind_"  
	-  need for wanting to build a reputation  
2. Learn typing for 10 minutes on http://typing.io 
3. What's **coding** got to with Skills 2022? http://j.mp/skills2022 
	- Important slide - save it for future reference 
4. Visualize code using Python Tutor 
	- Mystery 7, http://j.mp/revtutor and then http://j.mp/reverseCC 
5. Introduce repl.it for trying out C code and for printf, etc. 
6. Learning to learn - Threshold concepts
