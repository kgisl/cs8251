## Day of Year 


Consider the problem of date conversion, from day of the month to day of the year and vice versa. For example, March 1 is the 60th day of a non-leap year, and the 61st day of a leap year. Define the function to do the conversion: 

**day\_of\_year** converts the month and day into the day of the year, and 

**month_day** converts the day of the year into the month and day


### Example 

`day_of_year(2012, 3, 1)` == 61
`day_of_year(2011, 3, 1)` == 60


### Pointer practice

Modify / Refactor the existing code to use pointers to come up with the appropriate solution.
