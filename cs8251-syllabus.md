**CS8251 PROGRAMMING IN C L T P C 3 0 0 3 OBJECTIVES:**

 - To develop C Programs using basic programming constructs
 - To develop C programs using arrays and strings  
 - To develop applications in C using functions , pointers and structures
 - To do input/output and file handling in C

**UNIT I BASICS OF C PROGRAMMING 9** Introduction to programming
paradigms - Structure of C program - C programming: Data Types – Storage
classes - Constants – Enumeration Constants - Keywords – Operators:
Precedence and Associativity - Expressions - Input/Output statements,
Assignment statements – Decision making statements - Switch statement -
Looping statements – Pre-processor directives - Compilation process

**UNIT II ARRAYS AND STRINGS 9** Introduction to Arrays: Declaration,
Initialization – One dimensional array – *Example Program: Computing*
*Mean, Median and Mode* - Two dimensional arrays – *Example Program:*
*Matrix Operations (Addition, Scaling, Determinant and Transpose)* - String
operations: length, compare, concatenate, copy – Example Program: 
*[Selection sort][1], linear and binary search*

**UNIT III FUNCTIONS AND POINTERS 9** Introduction to functions:
Function prototype, function definition, function call, Built-in
functions (string functions, math functions) – Recursion – Example
Program: *Computation of Sine series, Scientific calculator using*
*built-in functions, Binary Search using recursive functions* – Pointers –
Pointer operators – Pointer arithmetic – Arrays and pointers – Array of
pointers – *Example Program: Sorting of names* – Parameter passing: Pass
by value, Pass by reference – *Example Program: [Swapping of two numbers][2]*
*and changing the value of a variable using pass by reference*

**UNIT IV STRUCTURES 9** Structure - Nested structures – Pointer and
Structures – Array of structures – *Example Program using structures and*
*pointers* – Self referential structures – Dynamic memory allocation -
*Example Program: Singly linked list* - typedef

**UNIT V FILE PROCESSING 9** Files – Types of file processing:
Sequential access, Random access – Sequential access file - *Example*
*Program: Finding average of numbers stored in sequential access file* -
Random access file - *Example Program: Transaction processing using*
*random access files* – Command line arguments

**OUTCOMES**: Upon completion of the course, the students will be able to

 - Develop simple applications in C using basic constructs
 - Design and implement applications using arrays and strings
 - Develop and implement applications in C using functions and pointers
 - Develop applications in C using structures
 - Design applications using sequential and random access file
processing
